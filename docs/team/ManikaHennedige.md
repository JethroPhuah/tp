### PPP

This project presented us with the opportunity of a lifetime, to collaborate in a relatively
consequence-less programming project. This course taught us a lot on project and time management, 
as well as important technical skills. One of the most useful things I learned from this course
would have to be the incorporation of Git source control into almost every assignment in this
course. This skill is invaluable and will most definitely be useful in the future - it allows
for such seamless collaboration, and forces us to efficiently allocate and distribute work
on different parts of code in order to further progress.

Not sure exactly what PPP stands for, but I will be sure to find out about this in due course!
